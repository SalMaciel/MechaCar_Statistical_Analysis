## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Using Rstudio, we will answer the following questions.
- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
    - Vehicle weight spoiler angle and and AWD have p values, greater than 0.05.
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
    - The multiple R-squared value is 0.7, the linear model is not near zero.
- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
    - Overall, this linear model has a significance value lower than 0.05, which suggest that there is a strong chance that the results produced were by chance.
